# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms in Python

Welcome to my personal journey through mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Python**. This repository tracks my hands-on learning, inspired by the book **“Grokking Data Structures”**, and includes code samples, notes, and reflections as I build intuition and skill from the ground up.



## 📚 Details
- **Language**: Python
- **Goal**: Build deep understanding of core data structures and their time-space tradeoffs, with clean, reusable code and analogies that make concepts stick.



## ✅ Topics Covered So Far

| Topic                     | Status        | Notes                                                  |
|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Arrays (unsorted/sorted) | ✅ Completed   | Learned insert, delete, search, and resizing logic     |
| Time & Space Complexity  | ✅ Completed   | Practiced Big-O analysis and memory tradeoffs          |
| Linked Lists             | 🚧 In Progress | Building singly linked list from scratch               |



## 🛠️ Tools & Practices

- Python classes and modular design
- Manual memory management (e.g. dynamic arrays)
- Debugging with print statements and assertions
- Gentle analogies to reinforce intuition
- Iterative refactoring for clarity and performance



## 🔮 What's Next

- Doubly Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees & Graphs
- Sorting & Searching Algorithms
- Recursion & Dynamic Programming
